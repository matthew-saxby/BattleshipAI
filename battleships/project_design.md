# Battleships Contest Project Design & Requirements
#### _By Matthew Getgen and Joey Gorski_


## Project Goal
To create a Battleships Contest Program that runs and handles a game and contest of Battleships played by a number of AIs.


## Project Requirements
- Run a game of battleships between two AIs.
- Run a match of multiple games between two AIs.
- Run a contest of matches between multiple AIs (some tournament method).
- Create a system that is compatible with multiple programming languages.
- Display actions taken by each AI on the screen.
- Store game and contest data.
    - Print the end result to the user and store all data to a log file.
- Display match or contest data effectively.


## Definitions
- `Turn`: 1 AI 1 action.
- `Round`: Each AI's turn.
- `Game`: Set of rounds between AI with an outcome. (Like a game of battleships with your friends).
- `Match`: Set number of games between two AI players.
- `Contest`: Set of matches between all available players.


## Message Requirements and Design
>_Main Idea:_ send everything as a JSON string for simpler language support.

### Messages Types and related Content
**Server messages to send:**
- Setup Match
    - board size
    - player number (1 or 2)
- Start Game
- Place Ship
    - length
- Take Shot
- Shot Return
    - player number (1 or 2)
    - row
    - col
    - shot value
        - hit       (X)
        - miss      (M)
        - duplicate (D)
- Ship Dead
    - player number (1 or 2)
    - row
    - col
    - direction
        - horizontal(H)
        - vertical  (V)
    - length
- Game Over
- Match Over

**Player messages to send:**
- Hello (lets server know who you are and that you're alive)
    - ai name
    - author name(s)
- Ship Placed
    - row
    - col
    - direction
        - horizontal(H)
        - vertical  (V)
    - length
- Shot Taken
    - row
    - col


### Message Communication Protocol
Packet Communication Method:
| Message Num | Message Name  | Player1 |     | Server |     | Player2 |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------- | --- | ------ | --- | ------- |
|           1 | `hello`       | player1 |  -> | server | <-  | player2 |
|           2 | `setup_match` | player1 | <-  | server |  -> | player2 |
|           3 | `start_game`  | player1 | <-  | server |  -> | player2 |
|           4 | `place_ship`  | player1 | <-  | server |  -> | player2 |
|           5 | `ship_placed` | player1 |  -> | server | <-  | player2 |
|           6 | `take_shot`   | player1 | <-  | server |  -> | player2 |
|           7 | `shot_taken`  | player1 |  -> | server | <-  | player2 |
|           8 | `shot_return` | player1 | <-  | server |  -> | player2 |
|           9 | `ship_dead`   | player1 | <-  | server |  -> | player2 |
|          10 | `game_over`   | player1 | <-  | server |  -> | player2 |
|          11 | `match_over`  | player1 | <-  | server |  -> | player2 |

1. `hello` is sent from both players to the server after it connects.
2. `setup_match` is sent by the server at the start of each match. Tells players about match-specific data.
3. `start_game` is sent by the server at the start of each game.
4. `place_ship` is sent by the server at the start of each game to tell players to place ships.
5. `ship_placed` is sent by the player to tell the server where the ship was placed.
6. `take_shot` is sent by the server to tell the client to take a shot.
7. `shot_taken` is sent by the players to tell the server where it shot.
8. `shot_return` is sent by the server to tell both players the value of the shot.
9. `ship_dead` is sent by the server to tell both players that a ship has been killed.
10. `game_over` is sent by the server when a game is over.
11. `match_over` is sent to the players when the match is over, or there was a match-level error.

### Message Abbreviations and Examples
> JSON key words are abbreviated for smaller message sizes, message types are numbers for faster comparisons.

Abbreviation definitions can be found in the `source/defines.h` file, or assumed by context. 
The 
Look to the [message protocol](#message-communication-protocol) section for the message type numbers.

#### Examples
**Server:**
- `{ "mt": 2, "bs": 10, "pn": 1 }`
- `{ "mt": 3 }`
- `{ "mt": 4, "l": 5 }`
- `{ "mt": 6 }`
- `{ "mt": 8, "pn": 1, "r": 1, "c": 1, "v": HIT }`
- `{ "mt": 9, "pn": 1, "r": 1, "c": 1, "l": 5, "d": HORIZONTAL }`
- `{ "mt": 10 }`
- `{ "mt": 11 }`

**Player:**
- `{ "mt": 1, "ai": "example_ai_c++", "au": "Mamthew Gemchin and Goey Jorski" }`
- `{ "mt": 5, "r": 1, "c": 1, "l": 5, "d": HORIZONTAL }`
- `{ "mt": 7, "r": 1, "c": 1 }`

        - First 5, last 5
        - 5 wins, 5 losses, 5 ties, all errors

    - Ask for Contest Type:
        - Brandle Special
        - Round-Robin
